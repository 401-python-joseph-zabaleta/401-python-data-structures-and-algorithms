## Challenge 10
This challenge deals with the Call stack and queue. We will be creating a Stack Class and a Queue Class with several methods to manipulate / simulate the stack and queue.

### Unit Tests
#### Stack Tests
- [x] Can successfully push onto a stack.
- [x] Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack.
- [x] Can successfully pop off the stack.
- [x] Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops.
- [x] Can successfully peek the next item on the stack.
- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty stack.
- [x] Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises an exception.
#### Queue Tests
- [ ] Can successfully enqueue into a queue.
- [ ] Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue.
- [ ] Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value.
- [ ] Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value.
- [ ] Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues.
- [ ] Can successfully instantiate an empty queue.
- [ ] Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception.

## Approach & Efficiency


## API
### Class Stack:
- `push(self, item)`
    - explain
- `pop(self)`
    - explain
- `peek(self)`
    - explain
- `is_empty(self)`
    - explain

### Class Queue:
- `enqueue(self, item)`
    - explain
- `dequeue(self)`
    - explain
- `peek(self)`
    - explain
- `is_empty(self)`
    - explain
