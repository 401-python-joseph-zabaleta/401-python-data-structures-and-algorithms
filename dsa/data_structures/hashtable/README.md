# Hash Table
[Table of Contents](../../../README.md)
## Challenge 30
Implement a HashTable with the following methods:
1. [] `add`: Takes in both the key and value. This method should hash they key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
2. [] `get`: Takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
3. [] `contains`: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if they key exists in the table already.
4. [] `hash`: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## User Tests
1. [] Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure.
2. [] Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
3. [] Successfully return a null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
4. [] Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
5. [] Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
6. [] Successfully hash a key to an in-range value
