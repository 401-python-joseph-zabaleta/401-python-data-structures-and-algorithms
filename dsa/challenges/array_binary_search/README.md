# Binary search in a sorted 1D array
[Table of Contents](../../../README.md)
## Challenge 03
Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

### Example:
|Input|Output|
|:-----|:------:|
|[4,8,15,16,23,42], 15|2|
|[11,22,33,44,55,66,77], 90|-1|

## Approach & Efficiency
In BinarySearch function I needed a way to compare the search key value to each element of the input array. To do this I utlized a for in range loop with the range equal to the length of the input array. Each iteration array at i was compared to the search key, if a match occured then stop looping and return that index value. If the loop completes its cycle with no match then it hits the return -1 block.
