# Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that splits and incoming list in half, sorting the left and then sorting the right. After both are sorted, merge them back together.

## Efficency
<!-- * Time O(n^2)
    - The algorithm of this function is to compare each value in the list. This will happen n times for the list, and n-1 times inside the initial loop. The resulting algorithm ends up being n squared.
* Space O(1)
    - No additional space is being created. This list is being sorted in place. Keeping the space at constant O(1). -->
