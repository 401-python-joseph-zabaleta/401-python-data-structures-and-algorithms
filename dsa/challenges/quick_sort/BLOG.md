## Efficency
<!-- * Time O(log(n))
    - The basic algorithm for Merge Sort is to split the list into two halves, and continuing to repeat this process until the lists become the length of 1. Then finally merge them back together based on value. Since this function is continually splitting the lists into half like a binary search tree, time is O(log(n))
* Space O(n)
    - Since this function is constantly splitting the list, making small lists of the original one but not adding too it. We remain with the same amount of space taken up, so a split of 6 items is two lists of 3. Space remains unchanged. With this logic, our overall space complexity is O(n) or however long the original list is. -->
